Step 1: Configure Internal Network in VirtualBox
Shut down both VMs if they are running.

Open Oracle VirtualBox Manager.

For each VM (Kali and Ubuntu):

Go to Settings → Network → Adapter 1.

Enable the adapter and set:

Attached to: Internal Network

Name: intnet (or any custom name, just make sure it's the same on both)

▶ Step 2: Start Both VMs
Start the Kali and Ubuntu virtual machines.

🔍 Step 3: Identify Network Interface Name
In each VM, open the terminal and run:

ip a
Note the interface name (e.g., enp0s3, eth0) that corresponds to the internal network.

⚙ Step 4: Assign Temporary Static IP Addresses
On Ubuntu (assuming interface is enp0s3):

sudo ip addr add 192.168.56.2/24 dev enp0s3

On Kali Linux (assuming interface is eth0):

sudo ip addr add 192.168.56.3/24 dev eth0

Use the correct interface name based on ip a output.

✅ Step 5: Verify the IP Address
Run this command on both VMs to confirm:

ip addr show

You should see the assigned IP (192.168.56.x) under the respective interface.

📡 Step 6: Test Network Connectivity
From Kali, ping Ubuntu:
ping 192.168.56.2

From Ubuntu, ping Kali:
ping 192.168.56.3
If you get replies, the internal network is set up correctly and both VMs can communicate.

Step 7 : Now you can use your preferred method scp / ssh to transfer the files between the vm

scp textfile.txt ubuntu@10.0.2.15:/home/ubuntu/
